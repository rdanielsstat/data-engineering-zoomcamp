Build a REST API source for NYC taxi data.

API details:
- Base URL: https://us-central1-dlthub-analytics.cloudfunctions.net/data_engineering_zoomcamp_api
- Data format: Paginated JSON (1,000 records per page)
- Pagination: Stop when an empty page is returned

Place the code in taxi_pipeline.py and name the pipeline taxi_pipeline.
Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial.


I have working pipeline code now for the taxi_pipeline. review it and use the database it created for context and tell me, What is the start date and end date of the dataset?
