# Data Engineering Zoomcamp

Hands-on projects and notes from the Data Engineering Zoomcamp by [Alexey Grigorev](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev) and the [DataTalks.Club](https://github.com/DataTalksClub) team.

This repository follows the full course curriculum and contains exercises, experiments, and the final project, covering modern data engineering tools and best practices.

## Course Overview

The course is a practical, end-to-end introduction to data engineering, including:

- Containerization and infrastructure as code
- Workflow orchestration
- Data ingestion pipelines
- Data warehousing and analytics engineering
- Batch and streaming processing
- A final real-world project with peer review

## Tech Stack

Tools and technologies used throughout the course include:

- Docker and Docker Compose  
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)  
- Terraform  
- PostgreSQL  
- Kestra  
- BigQuery  
- dbt  
- Apache Spark  
- Kafka  
- Python and SQL  

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by modules and workshops:

```text
.
├── 01-containerization-iac    # IAC = infrastructure as code
├── 02-workflow-orchestration
├── 03-data-warehousing
├── 04-analytics-engineering
├── 05-data-platforms
├── 06-batch_processing
├── 07-streaming
└── final_project
```

Structure may evolve as the course progresses.

## Goals

- Build production-style data pipelines from scratch  
- Learn cloud-native data engineering workflows  
- Practice infrastructure automation and orchestration  
- Gain experience with both batch and streaming systems
